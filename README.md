## Special Wishes

This year, Santa (our digital version, of course!) is immersed in the virtual world collecting wishes!

We are not just about the tech, you know. We are about the people, the stories, the laughs. As we raise our glasses (or coffee cups for some of us) to the end of another year, we want to say a massive thank you. Thank you for being part of our story, for believing in us, and for helping us connect the DuskyDots!

It's a time to acknowledge how truly lucky we are, and that is because all of you!

To our clients, who've become more than just partners in business, but friends - your support from the start has been the wind beneath our wings. You've trusted us, believed in our vision.

To our dedicated team and contractors. Your commitment and hard work breathe life into our projects, turning visions into reality. Your expertise and camaraderie are the foundation of what DuskyDots is becoming.

To our suppliers, your reliability and excellence ensure that we always have the tools and resources we need to excel. You're an integral part of our daily operations and successes.

To our co-working offices in Queenstown and Auckland and to our accountants, your professionalism and support keep our business running smoothly. You provide the structure and guidance that enable us to focus on what we do best.

And to our families and friends, your support and encouragement fuel our passion and creativity. You are our safe harbor and our inspiration.

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and here's to doing more great things together in the New Year!

## A special thanks to the open-source libraries and assets behind this experience.
